This file contains the information this student’s management systems.

I have created two tables, Users and Students tables
Student	 users table in which the admin can use to create account and the be able to manage user information, such as creating, updating, deleting students’ information.
So, after user account creation admin can login to the system.
The system is able to keep the user information in session and cookies 

The sessions are across the whole pages except the user account creation
The cookie I used was to save the username and password in login form.

After the user logins to the system successfully the admin will be welcomed and then be able to register new student, delete and update the student’s information accordingly.

I also used to add login functionality so that when the user get logged out, he will not be able to access the students information until he logged in again.
When the user /admin have login in he will not access the login page again until he logged in.
I also attached the file of database in this project , it’s called data base.sql 

Any one who want to investigate what I did can used it by importing my project files and database file.
